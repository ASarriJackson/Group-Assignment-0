Initially setting up GitHub was a slightly tedious, but after that proved an effective way
 of sharing and collaberaing our code. We all worked on VScode to produce our .ipynb files, 
 this was also a bit challenging to set up due to have to install Anaconda and set up our
 virtual environments. We all think choosing to use VScode was appropriate due to its 
 seemless integration with github.
